Identify segments of low and high resolution in LWD images

1. Introduction

Image logs are valuable sources of information to support the development of petroleum fields.

They allow geoscientists to characterize visually and in a continuous manner different properties of the rocks perfurated by a well, which serve to construct more reliable geological models of the field - leading to more realistic production curves. 

Low resolution images or those with strong non-geological attributes (i.e. pixelated images, distortion, noise, etc.) - in other words, displaying low quality - are hard to interpret, losing part of its potential value.

Images obtained with LWD tools reduce the cost of acquisition, when compared to those obtained with wireline tools. However, they are also more susceptible to operational problems and, consequently, to present lower quality.

The Figure below exemplifies well segments with low (red flag) and high (green flag) quality.
